My name is Alexandru Ene, I work as a Senior Engineer at Amazon (prev: engine guy at Ubisoft, EA, City Interactive and Ubisoft again) and I like doing various fun experiments in my spare time.  
I will write about random programming stuff that I hack away at while outside office hours.  
Most of the work I do these days is in Rust.
I think Python is quite an awesome and elegant language and I started using it more often for prototypes, small programs and automation of various tasks.  
You can find me on on various places on the web by clicking the links below:

And this is a picture of me looking at a painting of a suspicious bust, a nude and some green leaves:
